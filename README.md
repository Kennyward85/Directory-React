# Employee Directory
Implemented Search by first Name and last Name that takes place on submission 
Also allowed for Alphabetizing all columns except for phone number. 

# Documentation
I somehow Deleted the numerous links I used to build this but it primarily consisted of 
https://reactjs.org/

## User Story

I want the user to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that they have quick access to their information.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees will render 
and you will be able to search by name or sort alphabetically between the table headers

The user should be able to:

  * Sort the table by at least one category
  * Filter the users by at least one property.
